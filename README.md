# Maxit
Maxit is usually played on an n x n grid of squares. Each square contains a value ranging from -9 to 15. One of the squares is 
initially designated with a marker (**) indicating the current position. Player 1 may take any square on the same row as the 
marker. When Player 1 is done, Player 2 makes a similar move, except choosing between the squares in the column.
Play alternates until all squares are taken or until a player is left without a valid move. The player with the most points 
at the end is the winner.

Includes 2 modes of play:
1) Single Player
2) Two Player
