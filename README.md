# Maxit

Maxit is usually played on an n x n grid of squares. Each square contains a value ranging from -9 to 15. One of the squares is 
initially designated with a marker (**) indicating the current position. Player 1 may take any square on the same row as the 
marker. When Player 1 is done, Player 2 makes a similar move, except choosing between the squares in the column.
Play alternates until all squares are taken or until a player is left without a valid move. The player with the most points 
at the end is the winner.

Includes 2 modes of play
1) Single Player - Where the player plays against the program
2) Two Player - Where two players play against each other

Bitmask DP algorithm used by the program in the single player mode of the game to make the most optimal move
possible every time, based on the current state of the grid to maximize computerâ€™s score.
State of the grid decided by
1) position - Current position of the pointer
2) gridState - Bitmask containing positions of the grid that are not taken 
3) turn - Indicates if it is X's turn or Y's turn
